# Role-Based-Ai-Driven-Chatbot
To develop a rule-based and AI-driven chatbot for your platform ZenSpace using Tidio, you'll need to create a robust chatbot flow. Tidio allows you to integrate rule-based responses and AI-driven chatbots, which can be integrated with your website or platform.
Overview

    Rule-Based Chatbot: This is where the chatbot responds based on predefined rules (e.g., greetings, FAQs, customer queries).
    AI-Driven Chatbot: Using AI (such as GPT-based models) to provide dynamic responses to user queries that are not covered in the rule-based flows.
    Tidio Integration: Tidio provides a platform where you can create and deploy bots easily, and it supports both rule-based automation and AI chatbots.

Step-by-Step Process

We'll first create the foundational rule-based chatbot using Tidio, then enhance it with AI capabilities.
Step 1: Set up Tidio and Create a Chatbot Flow

To start using Tidio, you need to set up an account and integrate it with your website:

    Sign up on Tidio.
    Once logged in, go to the Bots section.
    Create a new bot to define the chatbot flow (rule-based).
    Customize your chatbot with the necessary questions and predefined answers.

You can create different trigger rules in Tidio that will launch specific actions or send replies based on user inputs. Below is an example of how to integrate Tidio for rule-based responses.
Step 2: Rule-Based Responses

import requests
import json

# Example API URL for Tidio (Replace with your actual Tidio bot API endpoint)
TIDIO_API_URL = "https://api.tidio.co/v1.0/bots"

# Example of a payload for rule-based responses
payload = {
    "name": "ZenSpaceBot",
    "introduction": "Hello! How can I help you today?",
    "rules": [
        {
            "trigger": "greet",
            "responses": [
                "Hi there! How can I assist you today?",
                "Hello, how can I help you?"
            ]
        },
        {
            "trigger": "product_query",
            "responses": [
                "We offer a variety of home automation products. Can you specify your needs?",
                "Our platform provides smart home solutions. What type of automation are you looking for?"
            ]
        },
        {
            "trigger": "thank_you",
            "responses": [
                "You're welcome! Let me know if you need further assistance.",
                "Glad I could help!"
            ]
        },
    ],
    "fallback_response": "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you please clarify?"
}

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TIDIO_API_KEY'  # Replace with your actual Tidio API key
}

# Sending the request to Tidio API to create the bot
response = requests.post(TIDIO_API_URL, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Bot created successfully!")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

Explanation:

    The payload contains triggers like "greet", "product_query", and "thank_you", each associated with specific responses. When a user types one of these keywords, the bot will respond accordingly.
    The fallback_response is triggered if the chatbot doesn't understand the user's input.
    Replace "YOUR_TIDIO_API_KEY" with your actual Tidio API key, which you can get from your Tidio dashboard under the settings section.
    The requests library is used to send API calls to Tidio to create the chatbot and set the rules.

Step 3: Add AI Capabilities with OpenAI Integration

You can enhance the chatbot by integrating AI-powered conversations to handle more complex user queries. We'll use OpenAI GPT-3 (or GPT-4) to generate intelligent, human-like responses.

Here's how to integrate GPT-based responses into your Tidio chatbot.
Step 3.1: Integrating OpenAI with Tidio for AI Chatbot Responses

    Install OpenAI:

    pip install openai

    Python Code for AI Chatbot Integration:

import openai
import requests
import json

# Set up OpenAI API key (Replace with your API Key)
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

# Function to get AI response using OpenAI GPT
def get_ai_response(user_input):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # You can replace with gpt-4 if available
        prompt=user_input,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Function to send AI response to Tidio
def send_ai_response_to_tidio(user_input):
    ai_response = get_ai_response(user_input)

    # Tidio API Endpoint for AI responses (replace with your actual URL)
    TIDIO_API_URL = "https://api.tidio.co/v1.0/message"

    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TIDIO_API_KEY',  # Replace with your actual Tidio API key
    }

    # Payload for sending message to Tidio
    payload = {
        "message": ai_response,
        "user_input": user_input,
    }

    response = requests.post(TIDIO_API_URL, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("AI response sent to Tidio successfully!")
    else:
        print(f"Error sending AI response: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

# Example usage
user_input = "Can you recommend a smart thermostat for my home?"
send_ai_response_to_tidio(user_input)

Explanation:

    The function get_ai_response() sends the user input to OpenAI's API and retrieves a response based on the GPT model.
    The function send_ai_response_to_tidio() sends the generated AI response to the Tidio bot, allowing it to display dynamic responses.
    Tidio API is used to send the response back to your chatbot.

Step 4: Test and Deploy

    Testing: Test both rule-based and AI-driven responses on your platform. Make sure the chatbot works with common phrases and also handles more complex user inquiries using the AI functionality.
    Deployment: Once everything is working, deploy the Tidio integration onto your website or platform. You can embed the chatbot widget into ZenSpace using the Tidio integration code provided by Tidio.

Step 5: Additional Features

If you require further enhancements, you could also integrate:

    Analytics: Use Tidio's built-in analytics to track user interactions, engagement, and chatbot performance.
    Multi-Language Support: You can integrate multi-language capabilities using GPT-based responses to handle different languages.
    Authentication & Data Privacy: For secure access, consider adding OAuth or JWT tokens for user verification and authentication.

Conclusion

This solution will provide you with a rule-based chatbot for immediate responses and a more sophisticated AI-driven chatbot using GPT for dynamic interactions. Tidio makes it easy to manage, and integrating OpenAI for intelligent responses will enhance the user experience significantly.
